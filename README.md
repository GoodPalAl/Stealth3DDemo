# Stealth 3D Demo
(name pending still)

This is a demo of a 3D stealth game that I have been working on and off on since my independent study in school.

Some features included:
- Level decoding and reloading via json serialization
- Third-person camera following
- AI detecting of player

This is a very early beta.
